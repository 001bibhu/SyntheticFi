## What is SyntheticFi?

SyntheticFi enables you to turn your investment portfolio into usable cash while keeping your investments intact.

Instead of selling stocks or ETFs, SyntheticFi uses your portfolio as collateral and structures financing through public markets. This allows you to receive cash today and repay it later at a known cost.

In simple terms:

- You need cash
- You want to stay invested
- SyntheticFi helps you access liquidity without selling

The platform handles the full lifecycle, including collateral management, trade execution, and monitoring.

## Why SyntheticFi exists

Many investors have significant wealth in their portfolios but limited available cash.

Selling investments can:

- Trigger capital gains taxes
- Disrupt long-term strategies
- Create timing risk

SyntheticFi provides a way to access cash while staying invested, helping investors meet short-term needs without changing their long-term plans.

## High-level workflow

Here is how SyntheticFi works from start to finish:

1. **Connect portfolio**: Link your brokerage or custodian account
2. **Review eligibility**: Evaluate portfolio value and financing capacity
3. **Structure financing**: SyntheticFi sets up a market-based financing strategy
4. **Receive cash**: Funds are delivered to your account
5. **Monitor during the term**: Track portfolio value and margin status
6. **Repay and close**: Repay at the agreed cost and release collateral

## How SyntheticFi creates financing

SyntheticFi uses public market instruments to structure financing with a predictable outcome.

One of the key strategies used is called a **box spread**.

A box spread combines multiple options contracts to create a fixed future payoff. This payoff behaves like a loan:

- You receive cash today
- You repay a fixed amount later

Unlike traditional investing, this approach is not based on predicting market direction. It is designed to produce a known outcome regardless of how the market moves.

### Box spread (simplified)

The strategy combines:

- Buying a call option
- Selling a call option
- Buying a put option
- Selling a put option

All positions are set at specific prices and expire at the same time.

Together, they create a fixed difference between what you receive today and what you repay later.
