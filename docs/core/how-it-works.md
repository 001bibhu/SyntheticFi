# How it works

This guide explains how SyntheticFi turns an investment portfolio into cash—what happens to your holdings, how financing is structured, and what to expect from start to finish.

---

## The big picture

SyntheticFi follows a consistent pattern:

```
Portfolio connected → Collateral verified → Financing structured → Cash delivered
        ↓
Active term (monitoring) → Repayment → Collateral released
```

Your portfolio stays invested. SyntheticFi uses it as backing for structured financing rather than requiring a sale.

## Portfolio as collateral

### What "collateral" means here

Your brokerage or custodian account holds stocks, ETFs, and other eligible assets. SyntheticFi evaluates:

- **Total portfolio value** — Current market value of eligible holdings
- **Composition** — Which assets qualify (some holdings may be excluded)
- **Concentration** — Over-weighted single positions may require adjustment
- **Liquidity** — How easily holdings can be valued and monitored

Based on this review, SyntheticFi determines how much financing the portfolio can support—similar in concept to a **loan-to-value (LTV) ratio**, but applied to securities rather than real estate.

### What stays the same

- You remain the beneficial owner of your investments
- Dividends and corporate actions generally flow to you (subject to program terms)
- Your advisor retains visibility per firm permissions

### What changes

- A defined portion of the portfolio is **pledged** to secure the financing
- Those pledged holdings are **locked** for the financing term (see below)
- You must maintain sufficient portfolio value to satisfy margin requirements

---

## What "locking" means

**Locking** restricts certain actions on pledged holdings during an active financing term.

While locked, you typically **cannot**:

- Sell the pledged securities
- Transfer them to another account
- Use them as collateral elsewhere (without SyntheticFi approval)

You **can** usually:

- View positions and performance
- Receive dividends (program-dependent)
- Work with your advisor to add collateral or adjust the structure if needed

Locking protects the financing structure. When you **repay and close**, locks are removed and full control returns to normal account operations.

```
Before financing:     [ Portfolio — full flexibility ]
During financing:     [ Portfolio — pledged portion LOCKED ]
After repayment:      [ Portfolio — full flexibility restored ]
```

## How SyntheticFi structures financing

SyntheticFi is a **structuring platform**, not a simple line of credit from a bank.

### Step 1: Define the need

You specify (with your advisor):

- **Cash amount** required
- **Intended use** (e.g., home purchase, taxes)
- **Preferred term** or repayment timeline

### Step 2: Match to portfolio capacity

SyntheticFi calculates maximum eligible financing based on portfolio value, haircuts on specific holdings, and firm-level limits.

### Step 3: Structure in public markets

SyntheticFi executes a financing structure through public markets. This may involve options-based strategies (such as box spreads) that produce a **defined cash amount** and **defined cost** for the term.

You do not trade these instruments yourself. SyntheticFi's infrastructure and approved counterparties handle execution, subject to compliance and risk controls.

### Step 4: Deliver cash

Once structured and confirmed, cash is sent to the designated account—often the same brokerage account or a linked bank account, depending on program setup.

**No deep math required on your part.** You receive disclosures showing cash received, total cost, key dates, and margin requirements.

## Financing lifecycle

### Phase 1: Origination

| Step | What happens |
|------|----------------|
| Account linking | Connect brokerage/custodian via secure integration |
| KYC & compliance | Identity verification and regulatory checks |
| Term sheet | Review amount, cost, term, and margin thresholds |
| Acceptance | Client (and advisor, if applicable) confirms |
| Execution | Structure is placed; collateral is locked |

**Typical timeline:** 1–5 business days for standard integrations; longer for manual or custom setups.

### Phase 2: Active term

During the financing term:

- **Portfolio is monitored** daily (or intraday for large positions)
- **Value alerts** notify you if the portfolio approaches margin thresholds
- **Statements** show outstanding balance, cost accrual (if applicable), and collateral status
- **Advisor dashboard** provides firm-level visibility (see [Admin guide](./admin-guide.md))

### Phase 3: Repayment and closure

Repayment options depend on program terms:

- **Full repayment** at term end (most common)
- **Early repayment** (may be allowed with adjusted economics)
- **Roll or extend** (subject to re-qualification and new terms)

Upon full repayment:

1. Financing structure is unwound
2. Collateral locks are released
3. Confirmation is sent to client and advisor
4. Account returns to standard operating status

---

## What happens if the market drops

Portfolio value fluctuates. If your portfolio **declines**, collateral coverage weakens. SyntheticFi handles this through a **margin framework**.

### Margin thresholds (simplified)

```
Healthy        →  Portfolio comfortably covers financing
Warning        →  Approaching minimum coverage — action recommended
Margin call    →  Coverage below required level — action required
Remediation    →  Add collateral, partial repayment, or restructure
```

### Your options when notified

1. **Add collateral** — Transfer additional eligible securities or cash into the account
2. **Partial repayment** — Reduce the outstanding financing amount
3. **Restructure** — Work with SyntheticFi and your advisor to adjust terms (if available)
4. **Liquidation (last resort)** — If no action is taken, pledged holdings may be sold to restore required coverage

SyntheticFi sends notifications by email and in-platform alerts. Advisors receive parallel notifications for client accounts they manage.

**Important:** Margin events are not failures—they are a normal part of portfolio-backed financing. Proactive monitoring reduces the risk of forced liquidation.

## Repayment and closure

### Standard repayment

At the end of the term, you repay the **principal plus the agreed fixed cost**. Payment methods include:

- ACH from a linked bank account
- Journal of cash within the brokerage account
- Wire transfer (for larger amounts)

### Early closure

If you repay before the scheduled end date, economics may differ from the original term sheet. Review early repayment terms before originating.

### After closure

- All locks removed
- Financing marked closed in dashboard and statements
- Tax reporting documents issued as applicable (consult your tax advisor)

## Data and security flow

```
[ Brokerage / Custodian ]  ←→  [ SyntheticFi Platform ]  ←→  [ Advisor Dashboard ]
         ↑                              ↑
    Holdings & balances            Structuring & monitoring
```

SyntheticFi reads portfolio data through secure, read-only (and where required, trading) integrations. Credentials are never stored in plain text; OAuth and API tokens follow industry standards.
