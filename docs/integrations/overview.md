# Integrations overview

SyntheticFi connects to brokerages, custodians, and partner systems to read portfolio data, execute financing structures, and deliver a seamless experience for advisors and investors.

This page explains how integrations fit together and how data flows through the platform.

---

## Why integrations matter

Portfolio-backed financing requires **accurate, timely data** about holdings and account status. SyntheticFi integrates directly with custodians and brokerages so that:

- Portfolio values stay current for eligibility and margin monitoring
- Collateral can be locked and released programmatically
- Advisors see unified client data in one dashboard
- Partners embed SyntheticFi without manual data entry

---

## Integration categories

| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Brokerages** | Retail and direct brokerage accounts | Interactive Brokers, Schwab, Fidelity |
| **Custodians** | RIA and institutional custody | Schwab Advisor, Fidelity Institutional, Pershing |
| **Partner platforms** | CRM, planning, mortgage tech | Custom via API |
| **Identity & compliance** | KYC/AML verification | Integrated providers (behind the scenes) |

## How data flows

```
┌─────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐

```

### Inbound data (from custodians)

- Account metadata (type, owner, tax status)
- Positions and quantities
- Market values and cost basis (where available)
- Cash balances
- Corporate actions and dividends

### Outbound actions (to custodians)

- Collateral lock instructions
- Structuring trades (approved instruments only)
- Release of locks upon repayment

---

## Connection methods

### OAuth 2.0 (preferred)

Users authorize SyntheticFi at the custodian's login page. No passwords stored by SyntheticFi.

**Used for:** Schwab, Fidelity, Interactive Brokers, most retail flows

### API token (institutional)

Firm-level API credentials provisioned by the custodian for advisor enterprises.

**Used for:** Large RIAs, custom rep code mapping, bulk household import

### File-based (legacy)

End-of-day position files for custodians without real-time API.

**Used for:** Select institutional programs; higher latency for margin monitoring

---

## Sync frequency and latency

| Integration type | Holdings sync | Margin evaluation |
|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Real-time API | 15–60 minutes | Intraday (market hours) |
| End-of-day file | Next business day | Daily |
| Hybrid | Intraday + EOD reconcile | Intraday with EOD true-up |

Margin-critical accounts should use real-time API integrations where available.

2. **Receive eligibility** and present term sheets in your UI
3. **Subscribe to webhooks** for funding and margin events
4. **Display status** using financing and margin endpoints

Start here: [API overview](../platform/api-overview.md)

- Custodian tokens encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- SOC 2 Type II controls *(placeholder for production claim)*
- Data processing agreements with enterprise firms
- Least-privilege access scopes per custodian requirements

## Setting up integrations
