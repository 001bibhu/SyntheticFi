## How brokerage linking works

### User flow

1. User clicks **Connect account** in SyntheticFi (or partner app)
2. Selects brokerage from list
3. Redirected to brokerage login (OAuth)—credentials entered **only** on brokerage site
4. User approves data sharing permissions
5. Redirected back to SyntheticFi; sync begins automatically

```
User → SyntheticFi → Brokerage OAuth → SyntheticFi
                         (login)
```

Typical connection time: **2–5 minutes**

### Permissions requested

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Read account info | Identity and account type verification |
| Read positions | Eligibility and collateral valuation |
| Read balances | Cash and buying power |
| Trade *(where required)* | Execute structuring trades for financing |

SyntheticFi never requests withdrawal or transfer permissions beyond program scope.

## Data sync details

After linking, SyntheticFi syncs:

| Data | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Positions | 15–60 min (market hours) |
| Cash balance | 15–60 min |
| Account status | Hourly |
| Corporate actions | Daily |

Manual **Refresh** available in dashboard for most integrations.

---

## Collateral holds at brokerages

Retail brokerages implement holds differently than institutional custodians:

1. SyntheticFi marks securities as pledged in platform
2. Brokerage restriction prevents sale/transfer of pledged lot
3. User sees hold notation in brokerage portal (wording varies)
4. Release on repayment confirmation

Hold placement: typically **same business day** after funding for API-enabled brokerages.

---

## Disconnecting an account

Users can disconnect at **Settings → Integrations → Disconnect**.

**Important:** You cannot disconnect while an **active financing** exists. Repay or close financing first.

Revoking access at the brokerage site also stops sync but may leave financing in non-compliant state—always close through SyntheticFi first.

## Common issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Brokerage not listed" | Join waitlist via support; use supported brokerage if urgent |
| OAuth popup blocked | Allow pop-ups for SyntheticFi domain |
| Partial portfolio showing | Some sleeves (managed, crypto) excluded from sync |
| Token expired | Reconnect via Settings → Integrations |
